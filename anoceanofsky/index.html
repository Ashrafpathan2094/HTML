        <div class="contentText"><p>The ocean (also the sea or the world ocean)
            is the body of salt water that covers approximately 70.8% of the
            surface of Earth and contains 97% of Earth's water. An ocean can
            also refer to any of the large bodies of water into which the world
            ocean is conventionally divided.</p><br />
          <p>Separate names are used to identify five different areas of the
            ocean: Pacific (the largest), Atlantic, Indian, Southern
            (Antarctic), and Arctic (the smallest). Seawater covers
            approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) of the planet. The
            ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, and
            therefore integral to life on Earth. Acting as a huge heat
            reservoir, the ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the
            carbon cycle, and the water cycle.</p><br />
          <p>Oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical and
            horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions. The
            pelagic zone consists of the water column from surface to ocean
            floor throughout the open ocean. The water column is further
            categorized in other zones depending on depth and on how much light
            is present.</p></div>


        <div class="contentTitle">“I met a boy whose eyes showed me that the
          past, present and future were all the same thing.”</div>
        <div class="contentText"><p>The photic zone includes water from the
            surface to a depth of 1% of the surface light (about 200 m in the
            open ocean), where photosynthesis can occur. This makes the photic
            zone the most biodiverse. Photosynthesis by plants and microscopic
            algae (free floating phytoplankton) creates organic matter using
            light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients.</p><br />
          <p>Ocean photosynthesis creates 50% of the oxygen in earth's
            atmosphere. This upper sunlit zone is the origin of the food
            supply which sustains most of the ocean ecosystem. Light only
            penetrates to a depth of a few hundred meters; the remaining ocean
            below is cold and dark. </p><br />
          <p>Ocean temperatures depend on the amount of solar radiation reaching
            the ocean surface. In the tropics, surface temperatures can rise to
            over 30 °C (86 °F). Near the poles where sea ice forms, the
            temperature in equilibrium is about 2 °C (28 °F). Deep seawater
            temperature is between 2 °C (28 °F) and 5 °C (41 °F) in all parts
            of the ocean. Water continuously circulates in the oceans
            creating ocean currents.</p></div>

        <div class="contentText"><p>The terms "the ocean" or "the sea" used
            without specification refer to the interconnected body of salt water
            covering the majority of the Earth's surface. It includes the
            Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Southern and Arctic Oceans. As a
            general term, "the ocean" and "the sea" are often interchangeable,
            although speakers of British English refer to "the sea" in all
            cases, even when the body of water is one of the oceans.</p><br
            />
          <p>The contemporary concept of the World Ocean was coined in the early
            20th century by the Russian oceanographer Yuly Shokalsky to refer to
            the continuous ocean that covers and encircles most of
            Earth. The global, interconnected body of salt water is
            sometimes referred to as the world ocean, global ocean or the great
            ocean. The concept of a continuous body of water with
            relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental
            importance to oceanography.</p><br />
          <p>The entire ocean, containing 97% of Earth's water, spans 70.8% of
            Earth's surface, making it Earth's global ocean or world
            ocean. This makes Earth, along with its vibrant hydrosphere
            a "water world" or "ocean world", particularly in
            Earth's early history when the ocean is thought to have possibly
            covered Earth completely. The ocean is shaped irregularly,
            dominating Earth's surface unevenly, allowing the decernment of
            Earth's surface into a water and land hemisphere, as well as the
            division of the ocean into particular oceans.</p></div>
